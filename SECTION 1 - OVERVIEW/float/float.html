                Been to three world fairs, tow sheep shears, and a pig fuck, drank everything from rum to cum.<br/>

                My best friend just finished BUDS training and is soon to be deployed as a Navy Seal.<br/> 
                Over the holidays we went to see Lone Survivor, <br/>
                and like the punk I’ve known him to be, <br/>
                during the seen of recitation he stands up and belts out the Ballad. <br/>
                I asked him to recite it again afterwards <br/>
                and he did so with a few differences in perfect posture and<br/>
                a passion that seemed to be fired by his desire to protect and serve.<br/> 
                This is the Ballad he recited after the movie<br/>
                
                Thanks Will<br/>
